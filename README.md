## Task 1: Website Wireframe

Include screenshots of your website wireframe here. Make sure the wireframe is clear and easy to understand/read. To compliment your wireframes, describe the layout and how the elements are organized. Screenshots that are blurry or hard to read will be penalized. 

In addition to the screenshots, you can also a link to your wireframe file (if you used an online tool to create it). Make sure the link is accessible to the teaching team (check using an incognito window). This is not a replacement for the screenshots, but an additional resource for the teaching team to understand your wireframe.

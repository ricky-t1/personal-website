Github Etiquette
As you work on your mini-project, you should be making regular commits to your website repository. Each commit should have a meaningful message that describes what you did. You are graded on your use of git, including commit messages. Commit messages that do not provide a meaningful description of the changes made will result in a deduction of 1% marks, each.

For this mini-project, we expect to see a minimum of 30 meaningful commits (total) to the website repository (on average, this translates to ~3 commits per each issue/branch). You should break up your work into small, manageable tasks and commit your changes as you complete each task. Repositories with less than the specified number of commits will be penalized with a deduction of 1% for each missing commit.

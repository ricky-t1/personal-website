üåê Live Site

This project is my first experience with building a personal website. The technologies used were HTML and CSS. The website contains an about me section, hobbies, and education. There are also links to my GitHub, Leetcode, LinkedIn, resume, email contact, and this project page. However, my current resume is currently unavailable. There is a template resume in place at the moment.

The license chosen is MIT because it allows others to freely view, use my website code while giving me credit as the original author.

The navigation bar is in a fixed position which allows users to jump to the beginning of different sections: hobbies, about me, and education using anchor links that scroll the page. Each section is divided by horizonal lines and labeled with bold headings. Per section, there is a heading with texts, then ends with a relevant image. Footer includes links presented as icons keeping resources easily accessible and to show that users have scrolled to the absolute bottom. Navigation bar is smaller than footer, while the size of each section depends on the amount of content. However, the contents of each sections would not "leak" into each other when looking from the header.

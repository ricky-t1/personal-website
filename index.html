    <p>Hey! I am a Canada-born-and-raised, software developer with a problem-solving mentality and forever on the lookout for the next challenge. Back when I was 6 years old, while playing Mario Bros on the Nintendo GameCube, I remember questioning how it was possible that I was moving my digital character with a physical controller.
        I've forever asked the "why" and "how" whenever I've come across new technology. The questioning-like nature eventually led me into the world of coding, and I was instantly hooked!
        I genuinely enjoy the process of banging my head on my desk when my code won't work. The thrill of solving difficult problems drives me to be the best developer I can be.

        Iâ€™m currently spending my time learning, experimenting, and building small projects to keep growing my skills. My goal is simply to become the kind of developer who solves real problems, and to have fun creating impactful products!

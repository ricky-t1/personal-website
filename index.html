    <h1>Hello! </h1>
    <h1>This is Ricky Tat</h1></h1>
    <p>I'm a software development aspirant born in Canada with a huge love for problem-solving. Growing up, I've always asked the questions "why" and "how" whenever I come across new technology. That curiosity-like tendency then led me to explore the world of coding, where I found a way to turn my questions into solutions.
I'm headed towards a career in software development because I truly enjoy the process of banging my head against my desk when my code doesn't work! It's not so much about creating apps to me, it's about creating tools that really simplify people's lives a little bit.
 Iâ€™m currently spending my time learning, experimenting, and building small projects to keep growing my skills. My goal is simple: to become the kind of developer who solves real problems, and to have fun creating impactful products!git </p>
